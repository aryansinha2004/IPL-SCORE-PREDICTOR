IPL Score Predictor using Machine Learning

Introduction:
This project aims to predict the scores of cricket matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as team performance, player statistics, pitch conditions, and other relevant parameters, the model predicts the total score a team is likely to achieve in a given match.

Features:

Data preprocessing: Cleansing and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance.
Model selection: Utilizing different machine learning algorithms such as regression, ensemble methods, and neural networks to build predictive models.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
Deployment: Providing a user-friendly interface or API for users to input match parameters and obtain score predictions.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.
IPL match data: Historical match data including team performance, player statistics, pitch conditions, etc.
Installation:


Data preprocessing: Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the raw data.
